# The US Power Grid and its Optimality

## Project Statement

My project proposal document can be found in `proposal.pdf`. Below is a brief synopsis of my project mission statement. 

Seeing as the United States power grid is among the largest structures ever built, it is an excellent object of study in many areas of operations research. It remarkably continues to serve the energy needs of the largest economy on earth nearly at all times. Such a state of affairs does require a truly monstrous amount of maintenance to keep it operable. The physical network must be maintained as much as the configuration and optimality of power generation with respect to location, energy source mix, and regional energy economy substructure. 

We would like to ascertain how production and consumption associate with the *price of electricity* in a region, the *mix of fuels* in that region, and the typical *load on that region's power grid*. Monthly data on regional fuel sources and power grid load was retrieved via the `gridstatus` API which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kmax12/gridstatus/). The state-by-state data on price, grid capacity, and power production were retrieved using BeautifulSoup, and the web-scrape script is included in the notebook `Gratrix_Jacob_project.ipynb`.
